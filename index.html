    <h1 id="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        As a cybersecurity student at Brigham Young University, I am committed to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. My academic journey is complemented by my role as a Systems Administrator for BYU's Computer Science department, where I apply theoretical concepts to real-world challenges, ensuring robust and secure systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my administrative duties, I serve as the Vice President of the Network Engineering Association at BYU, where I design, create, and host lessons and activities that enhance our understanding of network engineering. My active involvement in the BYU Cyberia CTF Team, ranked #15 (top 0.2%) in the US and among the top 100 (top 0.4%) globally, reflects my passion for competitive cybersecurity and continuous learning. I also help teach weekly CTF lessons to BYU Cyberia's members, and host two CTFs at BYU a year, as well as one international CTF in the Spring.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond my academic and professional commitments, I am an avid Homelab Enthusiast who loves experimenting with new technologies. Iâ€™m also a big fan of Formula 1 racing, cooking, and building things with my hands.
